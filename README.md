A Unique Approach to Efficient Crowd-Sourced Mental Health Assistance

Welcome to EarthBrain, a novel, crowd-sourced mental health assistance forum that matches anonymous users and allows them to have constructive and positive discussions about similar issues or stresses. Communication is vital to providing adequate and targeted mental health treatment that is closely aligned with the needs of patients, and our product seeks to do this by connecting users with others with similar struggles, as well as providing additional resources to connect with licensed therapists and healthcare providers. EarthBrain is especially important as we understand that it is often difficult for many to express their mental health concerns due to fear of judgement or being ignored. 
To perform the matching, our recommendation algorithm creates a score based on users' age and interests and compares it with others' score to find the greatest similarity. Our machine learning sentiment classifier ensures all posts are positive and maintain a healthy and compassionate environment, and those that contain hate speech or other offensive/unhelpful/derogatory language are taken down.
